A website for my personal portfolio to showcase my skills, experiences, and projects. The site is divided into three sections. In the first section, services, there are my specializations. In the second section, projects, there are some projects that I worked on, and in the third section, communication, there is the phone number, which when pressed, goes to the contacts on the mobile when opening the site from the mobile, and there is my email. The site was programmed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Media Queries to make the site responsive to all screens.
